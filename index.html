                <p>
                <img src="olympiad.jpg" alt="" style="width:200px;height:auto;vertical-align: top;"/>
                <br>
                The summer prior to my first year of high school, I was super into natural science. I had so many unanswered questions like what the smallest particle 
                is in the world. Giving my competitive personality, I decided to join the olympiad program in my high school and chose chemistry for my subject. 
                Over the last thirty years in Iran, my home country, there were less than five people who won the gold medal of national chemistry Olympiad in their 
                sophomore year of high school. My goal was to be one those a few people, and I succeded. With more studying and training over my junior year of high school, 
                I won the gold medal of international chemistry olympiad with the second-highest theoretical score and third-highest total score.

                <h3>Academic Journey</h2>
                <p>
                Throughout my academic journey, I have developed a profound passion for 
                exploring the frontiers of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and its potential 
                to revolutionize various industries. At MIT, I have had the privilege of 
                engaging with cutting-edge research, attending thought-provoking lectures, 
                and collaborating with some of the brightest minds in the field. My rigorous 
                coursework and research experiences have provided me with a solid foundation 
                in both theoretical and practical aspects of computer science and mathematics.

                  <h3>AI Enthusiasm</h2>
                  <p>
                  AI has always been at the core of my interests, and I am particularly 
                  fascinated by the transformative power of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). 
                  Understanding the intricate relationships within complex data structures and 
                  leveraging that knowledge to solve real-world problems has been a driving 
                  force behind my studies. My enthusiasm for AI lies not only in its technical 
                  aspects but also in its potential to shape a better future for society.
                  </p>
                  <h3>Graph Neural Network Research</h3>
                  <P>
                  My focus on Graph Neural Networks has allowed me to delve deep into this 
                  exciting area of AI. Through various projects and research initiatives, 
                  I have explored the application of GNNs in diverse domains, including natural 
                  language processing and drug discovery. As a firm believer in open 
                  collaboration, I actively participate in discussions and contribute to the 
                  AI research community to foster innovation and drive progress.
                  </P>
                  <h3>Future Aspiration:</h2>
                  <p>
                  As I approach the final year of my undergraduate studies, I am excited about 
                  the prospects of continuing my journey in AI research. My goal is to pursue 
                  advanced studies in Artificial Intelligence, contributing my expertise to 
                  further the development of cutting-edge technologies that have a positive 
                  impact on our world.
                  </p>
      
                  <h3>Beyond Academics</h2>
                  <p>
                  When I'm not immersed in code or solving mathematical puzzles, you can find me  
                  running or rowing. Also, I love travelling.
